# Specify languages to analyze
languages:
  - java-kotlin  # Explicit Java and Kotlin scanning

# Note: Java/Kotlin does not support path-based filtering (paths/paths-ignore)
# CodeQL scans all Java/Kotlin files in the repository automatically

# Run additional security queries
queries:
  - uses: security-and-quality
  - uses: security-extended

# Suppress specific warnings
query-filters:
  # Certificate pinning not needed for public Open-Meteo API (no auth, public data)
  # Pinning would break on certificate rotation with no security benefit
  - exclude:
      id: java/android/missing-certificate-pinning
