## Text Content

- Short description (80 chars max)
- Full description (4000 chars max)

## Screenshot Tips

1. **Show the widget** - Main selling point is the home screen widget
2. **Multiple wallpapers** - Show widget works on light and dark backgrounds
3. **Light/dark mode** - Demonstrate theme adaptation
4. **Material You** - Show dynamic color theming if possible
5. **Clean home screen** - Don't clutter with too many other widgets

## Feature Graphic Tips

- Should be eye-catching and explain what the app does
- Consider showing a phone with the widget visible
- Keep text minimal (store listing has descriptions)
- Works well: gradient background + device mockup + simple tagline
